##Bookstore

##Overview

Bookstore is a Java-based desktop application built from scratch using IntelliJ IDEA and Gradle. The project follows a structured approach, integrating JavaFX for the graphical user interface and Uber Jar for creating an executable package. The application adheres to SOLID principles and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigms to ensure maintainability and scalability.

##Key Features:

-JavaFX User Interface – A responsive and interactive UI designed with JavaFX.

-DTO (Data Transfer Object) – Ensures data encapsulation and prevents direct access to sensitive information.

-Layered Architecture – Implements separation of concerns to improve maintainability.

-CRUD Operations – Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for database interactions.

-Security with SHA-256 – Password hashing using SHA-256 for enhanced security.

-Singleton Pattern – Used for managing the dependency tree efficiently.

-Caching Mechanism – Enhances performance by reducing redundant database calls.

-Bootstrap Script – Automates the creation of necessary database tables on startup.

-SOLID Principles – Ensures clean code structure and modularity.

-OOP Paradigms – Utilizes encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction for robust application design.


##Technologies Used

-JavaFX – UI development.

-Java – Core application logic.

-SQL – Database interactions.

-SHA-256 – Password hashing for security.

-Singleton Pattern – Dependency management.

-Design Patterns & Architectural Principles

-MVC (Model-View-Controller) – Organizes the codebase into logical components.

-Dependency Injection – Reduces tight coupling and improves testability.

-Component Factory – Streamlines object creation and management.

-Data Binding & ObservableList – Enhances UI responsiveness by syncing data with UI components.
